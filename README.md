Git Case Study - Streamlining Monthly Releases
Overview
In response to the challenges faced by Zendriix Softwares in managing their product releases, the proposed Git Workflow Architecture aims to provide an organized and predictable process for monthly releases. The primary objective is to ensure a smooth and reliable deployment on the 25th of every month.

Workflow Structure
Master Branch
Represents the production-ready code.
Release tags are created from this branch.
Feature Branches
Created for new features or enhancements.
Regularly merged into the master branch to maintain synchronization.
Release Branches
Created at the beginning of each month for upcoming releases.
QA and testing are conducted on the release branch throughout the month.
Bug fixes and release-specific changes are applied directly to the release branch.
Merged into the master branch and tagged for release on the 25th of the month.
Workflow Steps
1. Feature Development
Developers create feature branches for new features or enhancements.
Regularly merge changes from the master branch into feature branches.
2. Monthly Release Preparation
On the 1st day of the month, create a release branch for the upcoming release (e.g., release-1.0).
QA and testing are performed on the release branch throughout the month.
Bug fixes and release-specific changes are implemented directly on the release branch.
3. Release Day (25th of the Month)
Complete testing on the release branch.
Merge the release branch into the master branch.
Tag the master branch with the release version number (e.g., v1.0).
Deploy the tagged release to production.
4. Post-Release Activities
After the release, the release branch can be merged back into the master branch to ensure any bug fixes or improvements made during the release process are part of the mainline code.
Usage Guidelines
Feature Branches:

Feature branches should be short-lived.
Regularly merge changes from the master branch to avoid conflicts.
Release Branches:

Naming convention for release branches: release-<version> (e.g., release-1.0).
Only bug fixes and minor enhancements should be pushed directly to the release branch.
Master Branch:

Always stable and ready for production.
Developers should not directly commit to the master branch.
Example Commands
bash
Copy code
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Merge changes from master into the feature branch
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge master

# Create a new release branch
git checkout -b release-1.0

# Make bug fixes or small enhancements directly on the release branch
git checkout release-1.0
git commit -m "Fix a critical bug"

# Merge release branch into master
git checkout master
git merge release-1.0

# Tag the master branch for release
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"

# Push changes and tags to the remote repository
git push origin master --tags
Conclusion
This Monthly Release Git Workflow is designed to provide Zendriix Softwares with a structured and reliable approach to managing product releases. It ensures that code is thoroughly tested before deployment, reducing the risk of issues in production. Feel free to adapt and customize this workflow based on the specific needs and processes of Zendriix Softwares.
